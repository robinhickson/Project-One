# Techdegree Front End Web Development:
Project-One
Version 1.0

A dummy portfolio website. And my first ever self-built website!

I got a bit carried away, that seems obvious now. Once I'd started with flexbox implementation, it was quicker and easier to fix problems and continue than go backwards to a simpler design. I learnt alot in the process.

This is the first 'complete' version - but of course there's 100 things I could do differently. In particular, starting from 2x 1-page websites and then merging and adding pages with the new Flexbox template that I made, all contributed to a bloated css file (well, I think so. But what do I know?)
e.g I really need to go back and see if I can combine the card class and article classes, and then use ID to target specific pages and content.

It was fun. I'm hooked. Bring on Unit 2.
